# GifTastic
GIPHY API and JSON project
This is an application that pulls random gif images related to a set of animals from the GIPHY API. 

On initial page load, the app will dynamically build and append a button for each of the default animals. When clicked, up to 5 images of the specified animal are displayed dynamically.

The images are initially still. When an image is clicked, the gif will animate.

The user can add animal buttons to the array by entering the information in the form. The application will inform the user should no images be available for her/his chosen animal.

Technologies featured are AJAX and JSON.
